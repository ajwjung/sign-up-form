# Sign-up Form

## Objective

To demonstrate understanding of the basics of forms by creating a mock sign-up form using HTML and CSS. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

### Specifications

**Requirements**

1. There should be a left sidebar with a background image that has a logo plus text layered on top. The logo should have some kind of contrasting background to improve the readability of the text against the background image.

2. Use an external font for the "logo" section

3. Add form controls for supplying a first and last name, email, phone number, password, and password confirmation. The inputs should have a light border by default but can have two variations:
    * The password inputs should be given an error class (and thus some styling for invalid input)
    * Selected input should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow

4. A button to submit the form and "create an account". Use a color similar to tones found in the background image.

**Optional**

1. Use JavaScript to validate that the password fields match each other
